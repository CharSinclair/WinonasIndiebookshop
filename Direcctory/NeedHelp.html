        <h2>Help with an orphanded or injured animal:</h2>
        
            <p>Locate the closest state-licensed wildlife rehabilitator who works with the species: New as of 2025: Arctic Fox Daily is thrilled to have launched a new community resource in Upstate New York to help connect finders of injured or orphaned wildlife to licensed rehabbers via an emergency hotline, Finger Lakes Wildlife Hotline, reachable at 585-880-0168. The Animal Help Now website is also a GREAT resource for helping connect the public and rehabbers. This is an online database featuring rehabbers throughout the United States. In the meantime, if safely possible, keep the animal contained in a quiet, safe dark area with as little stimulation and human/pet traffic as possible and do not handle it. I do not recommend attempting to feed wildlife you find until they get to a rehabber, as it may do more harm than good if the animal is not yet stabilized and hydrated.</p>

        <h2>Help with captive bred or non-releasable wildlife:</h2>

            <p>Need placement for a captive-born fox, wolfdog, or other exotic pet or rescue? Since these animals are born in captivity, this means that they must stay in captivity, as it is both illegal and immoral to release a captive-bred wild animal. Please feel free to send me a detailed email <a href="Contact.html">HERE</a> if you need assistance. 
            
            Include the species, age, vet history (if any), temperament, any important details or quirks, and photos of the animal. Please note that depending on the species of animal and my capacity limitations, I cannot guarantee that I can intake your animal. <br>
            
            <b>***Wolfdog/Wolf Hybrid Placement Note**:</b> Like fox sanctuaries, many Wolfdog sanctuaries are always running at full capacity. For this reason, as cliché as it may sound, I STRONGLY suggest making a post on the Wolfdog rehoming groups you can find on Facebook. You'll have to request to join these groups (there are a couple) prior to posting. IF there is a facility or <u>qualified home</u> that is looking for a specific temperament, gender, content percent, etc., I guarantee they will be keeping their eyes on these Facebook group postings. You will have to use your own discretion when it comes to vetting potential homes.</p>

      <h2>Visiting and Volunteering</h2>
     
         <p>At this time, we are not open to the general public. We know this is a bummer for the many people who would love to see our animals in-person! The majority of our permanent residents have had very traumatic beginnings before they arrived here, and keeping our facility a private, home-based, sanctuary setting is the most peaceful option for them. Many of our residents would become stressed by a large amount of human traffic. Additionally, our rescue is not like many large facilities: We don't have "hours" or "staff", and our residents are part of our family, residing at our personal home. On a rare occasion, we offer short educational tours for local, small classes or clubs. We schedule these on a case-by-case basis based on our own discretion. Please note that, due to our strict special license regulations in New York State, we can NOT allow members of the public to have ANY physical contact with our residents, and any viewing occurs on the outside of enclosures. If we ever become set up to be able to offer small group tours on a regular basis, we will update this portion of our website to inform you! For now, please be sure to follow us on social media: The reason we started our social media pages was to allow supporters from all over the world to feel like they're a part of what we're doing and allow them to "get to know" our animals, since we can't provide in-person opportunities for everyone.</p>
